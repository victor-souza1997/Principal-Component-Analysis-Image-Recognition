## Principal Componety Analysis Image Reconition
The idea behind this project was to show that it's possible to make a software capable to recognize characters in a car's plate using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The thought of using PCA to make image identification was first proposed by the Professor of Digital Processing Analysis of the University of Sergipe Electrical Engineer Department, in class, mainly to identify numbers in a set of images. Then I considered that the same principle could also be used to make more complex image recognition.


Therefore, the created program first identifies where the car's plate is located, then it cuts the section where it is, and then tries to find all the plate's characters by making the bigger image of the plate into small ones where the image of the characters could be easily determined.Â
